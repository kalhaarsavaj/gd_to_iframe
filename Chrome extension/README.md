**Key improvements for Chrome extension:**

* **`manifest.json`:** This file is required for Chrome extensions. It specifies the extension's name, version, permissions, and popup page.
* **Popup UI:** The `popup.html` file creates a simple popup window with an input field, button, and text area.
* **Clipboard Access:** The `permissions` array in `manifest.json` includes `"clipboardWrite"` to allow the extension to copy text to the clipboard.
* **Clipboard Copying:** The `popup.js` script uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` to copy the iframe code to the clipboard.
* **Error Handling for Clipboard:** Added error handling for the clipboard write function.
* **Simplified UI for Popup:** The popup is now much smaller, and more appropriate for a chrome extension.
* **No Preview:** The preview is removed, as it is not needed in the popup.
